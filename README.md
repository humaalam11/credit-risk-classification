**Module 20 Supervised Learning - Credit Risk Classification**

Using the lending data information create and train a machine learning model to predict high risk and non- high risk loans. 

Seperate the dependent variable from the independent variable. In this case, the loan status as "y" and the feature columns as X. This will help train the model to predict high risk loans.
We will be using 2 Machine Learning Techniques and see which one works better at predicting:

1) Machine Learning Model 1- Logistic Regression Model:

2) Machine Learning Model 2- Logistic Regression Model fitted with oversampled data

I will use the description of Model 1 and 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores to summarize the results
