**Module 20 Supervised Learning - Credit Risk Classification**

By using the lending data information the goal is to create and train a machine learning model to predict high risk and non- high risk loans. Using pandas, I will be seperating the dependent variable from the independent variable. In this case, the loan status as "y" and the feature columns as X. This will help train the model to predict high risk loans.

The code will compare 2 Machine Learning Techniques and see which one works better at predicting the loan data:
1) Machine Learning Model 1- Logistic Regression Model
2) Machine Learning Model 2- Logistic Regression Model fitted with oversampled data

I will use the description of Model 1 and 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores to summarize the results. In the end, we will see that the results are very similar, with the second model predicting with a little more accuracy than Model 1.
